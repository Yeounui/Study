# R-CNN

Implementation of **R-CNN** model from the paper below,

The model is a classic model for object detection and sementatic segmentation. Since the source code is gone, the code is based on description as the paper explained.

The model is divided into three segments: Selective Search, AlexNet, and Support Vector Machine(SVM).

1. Selective search proposes category-independent regions via offering coordinates of bounding boxes. 2000 images in each bounding boxes are fed into AlexNet.

2. According to the suggestion of Selective search, bound images are warped to 227 X 227 size. This images are passed to the pretrained AlexNet, which is pruned at 8th softmax layer.

3. The output features are connected to a set of SVMs. Each SVMs corresponds to each category of an object to classify whether the bound image is in the category or not.
